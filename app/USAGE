Description:
    Creates a new basic front-end web application.

	Note: The only changes between this and the webapp generator is that there are some additional grunt commands that will create and provision a Heroku app, generate Heroku specific files, and commit to Heroku. For more information, check out Rapidly Deploy a Yeoman App to Heroku

Options:
    Bootstrap: Include Bootstrap for Sass

Example:
    yo webapp-heroku [--coffee]

    This will create:
        Gruntfile.js: Configuration for the task runner.
        bower.json: Front-end packages installed by bower.
        package.json: Development packages installed by npm.

        app/: Your application files.
        test/: Unit tests for your application.
